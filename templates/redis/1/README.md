# Redis Cluster Docker Images for Rancher

## You should not use previous versions for HA setups as this version is the first with persistent-volume claims!


This set of images and configurations is tailored to run a cluster of Redis instances for High Availability on Rancher.

The redis-server image (intlfcstone/rancher-redis-cluster-node on Docker hub) is a simple Redis image with enough logic to safely determine itself as a master or slave on startup.

The redis-sentinel image (intlfcstone/rancher-redis-cluster-sentinel on Docker hub) starts Redis Sentinel nodes that will automatically find the Redis instances, monitor them and most importantly, create/update automatically a "Rancher External Service" with the current IP of the Redis Master node. This allows to automatically target your traffic to the Redis Master Node without any additional software proxy.

*Warning: The Redis Instances are actually running in a Master/Slave mode, not a Multi Master Redis Cluster*
